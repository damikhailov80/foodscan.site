# Development Rules for FoodScan

## Language Requirements
- Write all notes, comments, and documentation in English
- Code comments are NOT allowed - code must be self-explanatory

## Design Principles
- Follow mobile-first responsive design approach
- Create adaptive layouts for different screen resolutions
- Always prioritize mobile experience first, then scale up for larger screens

## Code Style Requirements

### No Comments Policy
- Never add comments in code
- Code must be self-explanatory through clear naming and structure
- Use descriptive variable and function names instead of comments

### Styling Rules
- NEVER use inline styles
- All styles MUST be in separate CSS Module files (*.module.css)
- Always use CSS Modules approach for component styling
- Each component should have its own .module.css file

### Color Management
- All colors MUST be defined as CSS variables in `app/globals.css`
- Components MUST use ONLY CSS variables from the palette
- NEVER use hardcoded color values (hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, or color names)
- If a new color is needed, add it to `app/globals.css` first as a CSS variable, then use it

## File Structure
- Components: `app/components/ComponentName.tsx` + `ComponentName.module.css`
- Hooks: `app/hooks/hookName/useHookName.ts`
- Pages: `app/page.tsx` or `app/[route]/page.tsx`

## When Creating New Components
1. Create the component TypeScript file (.tsx)
2. Create the corresponding CSS Module file (.module.css)
3. Define any new colors in `app/globals.css` first
4. Import and use CSS variables for all styling
5. Ensure mobile-first responsive design

## When Modifying Existing Code
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- Remove any inline styles if found
- Replace hardcoded colors with CSS variables
- Ensure no comments are added

## Documentation
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested by the user
- Do not create README, SECURITY, DATABASE, or other markdown files proactively
- Update existing README.md only when explicitly asked
